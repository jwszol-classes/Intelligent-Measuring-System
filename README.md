## Intelligent Measuring System

Academic project at Gdansk University of Technology

### Topic 5 - description

Design and implement a measurement system that analyzes data on terrain height variation at points with the highest growth (North and South America). The height increase in a given location should be measured on the basis of 10 measurement points. Find 6 groups of the sink basing on the average growth of altitude. Put detected areas on the map.

#### Source dataset:

#### Additional information:

Recommended technologiese: EMR/Spark/Python/Scala/Java

Results should be presented in a graphic form, using a chosen library

#### Project developers (group 9):
